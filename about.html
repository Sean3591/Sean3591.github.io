        <p> I'm Sean Phelan, I have been playing video games and been wanting to create them for as long as I can remember. <br> I enjoy playing indie video games and watching GDC (game developer conference) <br> commentary. My hobbies include playing video games (as you can imagine) and <br> playing the piano. Recently, I've started playing a lot of a game called Celeste that was made in 2018, <br> I'm currently working on a song called Nocturne in E minor</p>
